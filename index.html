           <hr class="line">
              <p> Hi welcome, <br> I am Samson Fasuji a student of thinkful, I am taking software engineering course. I am was born and brought up in Nigeria, Lagos. I graduated highschool last year and I was inspired to be a software engineer by a friend. All my life in highschool I wanted to work with big machineries, but as much as I want that dream to come true, I couldn't see myself in that picture. My family background thought me that those who sit and work behind the computer are lazy people, because they don't do hardwork side from typing and reading. But this few weeks, I have learnt that mental work drains the body energy more and I understand that people who site behind the computer, put in a lot of energy. I am excited that I am getting a hand on this. If you are looking to hire a web developer or work on a combine project together, feel free to contact me. My contact will be somewhere on this page.</p>

              <h2> My Journey  </h2>
              <hr class="line">
              <P> In my highschool days I thought of playing football(soccer) or be a civil engineer. But seeing what I could do on a computer made me have a change of profession, I have learnt that the world has gone beyond man power. One could be in their house all day and make a lot of money. Well I am not doing this because of the money but because I now have passion for it. My first project i did was a food recipe website. I will live a link below. All I dream off now is to be a well known web developer. I want to work with great people around the work. </P>

              <p> I am also taking some ethical hacking courses to to be able to protect my works against other hacker and have more knowledge about nextworking. Here is the link to the recipe website<a class="recipe" href=" https://fash-me.github.io/odin-recipes/" target="_blank"> Click Here</a></p>
